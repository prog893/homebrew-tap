  # No `version` line: Homebrew scans it from the tag, and declaring both is
  # flagged as redundant. The tag is written out rather than interpolated as
  # "v#{version}", since style autocorrect sorts `url` above `version`, at which
  # point the interpolation resolves to a bare "v" and the clone fails with
  # "Remote branch v not found in upstream origin".
